# Codename Pyoro

A Bird and Beans remake for Playdate.

### Todo

### v1.0.3
- Added settings option to turn of music or sound effects
- Added falling leave effects to game 2. This is a feature from the original game that I held off on implementing because I thought the extra sprites would have a performance impact, and indeed they did. So there is now an extra setting in the menu: leaf effects 'off', 'on', or 'auto'. 'Auto' keeps the effects on until there are too many sprites on screen where framerate starts to significantly drop and then turns off the effects. If anyone wants to help me improve performance on this front, feel free to reach out.
- Added a more interesting loading screen transition 
- Added hills to the launcher card
- Fixed a bug where the flashing food would spawn too early if the screen was just cleared
- Fixed yet another main menu bug
- Fixed two almost-imperceptable graphical issues  

### v1.0.2

- Increased ground friction to more closely match the original
- Player velocity now increases along with bean speed
- Adjusted menu sound effects
- Fixed another main menu button bug

### v1.0.1

- Tweaked launcher animation
- Fixed main menu crash
- Fixed tongue persisting after death
- Fixed the tongue not speeding up when bean speed increases
- Tweaked scoring thresholds a tiny bit
