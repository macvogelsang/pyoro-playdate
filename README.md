# Codename Pyoro

A Bird and Beans remake for Playdate.

### Todo

Post MVP
- sfx / music options

### v1.0.3
- Added falling leave effects to game 2. This is a feature from the original game that I held off on implementing because I thought the extra sprites would have a performance impact, and I was right. Therefore there is now an extra setting in the menu: leaf effects 'off', 'on', or 'auto'. 'Auto' keeps the effects on until there are too many sprites on screen where framerate starts to significantly drop and then turns off the leaf falling effect. 
- Fixed yet another main menu bug
- Added cooler loading screen transition 

### v1.0.2

- Increased ground friction to more closely match the original
- Player velocity now increases along with bean speed
- Adjusted menu sound effects
- Fixed another main menu button bug

### v1.0.1

- Tweaked launcher animation
- Fixed main menu crash
- Fixed tongue persisting after death
- Fixed the tongue not speeding up when bean speed increases
- Tweaked scoring thresholds a tiny bit
